Two-decimal seconds preserve roughly a third of a metre, more precision than any consumer receiver can claim, and the display keeps both the pretty string and the raw values for copying.",

Results are true-north based; magnetic work adds your local declination, with pointers to geomagnetic models in the methodology.

Inputs are range-validated and errors explained, and the tiny map preview confirms both points landed where expected.",
