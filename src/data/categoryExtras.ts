  location: [
    "Prefer clicking the map over typing when you can: a placed pin is unambiguous, while a mistyped address can silently resolve to the wrong Springfield. When you must type, include the country for common town names and drop apartment numbers if the street fails — geocoders match best on street + city.",
    "Treat postal and administrative answers as different datasets. A 'wrong' city result is frequently a correct administrative answer disagreeing with a postal habit. If a form demands the mailing version, your postal service is authoritative; if it demands legal boundaries, the administrative layer is.",
    "Check accuracy before trusting a GPS-derived answer: indoors, browser positioning can be off by blocks, which flips counties near borders. Zoom the map and nudge the pin by hand when the stakes are real — the tools here let every GPS result be corrected with a click.",
  ],
  distance: [
    "Always confirm which distance you need before quoting one: straight-line for physical questions, road distance for driving, and network time for schedules. The three can differ by half again in mountainous or island geography, and quoting the wrong one is the most common distance mistake in reports.",
    "Remember that bearings are true-north by default. If you are transferring a bearing to a magnetic compass, add (or subtract) your local declination — it exceeds 10° in many inhabited regions and flips hemispheres of behaviour.",
    "Use the midpoint tool instead of averaging coordinates when splitting journeys: latitude/longitude averages distort over long legs and fail across the date line, while the spherical midpoint follows the actual path the distance was measured along.",
  ],
  routing: [
    "Add a congestion buffer to any free-flow travel time: 20–40% in peak urban areas is a sane rule of thumb, and the interface labels its times as free-flow for exactly this reason. For appointments, plan with the buffer; for physics, trust the raw number.",
    "Place route endpoints on roads, not rooftops. Routing engines snap points to the nearest drivable way, and a point in a river or a courtyard can snap somewhere surprising — nudging the pin to the nearest street makes results stable and explainable.",
    "When optimising many stops, keep the true origin first and let the engine order the rest; then sanity-check the result visually. Optimizers minimise distance, not your time windows — hard appointments still belong in manual order.",
  ],
  radius: [
    "Decide geometric vs temporal reach before drawing anything: a 10 km circle and a 15-minute drive area answer different questions, and in car-dependent geography they barely overlap in shape. Circles for policy radii, isochrones for response promises.",
    "Verify areas against a known object first — measure a football pitch or a city block you know — and you'll calibrate your eye for what a hectare or acre looks like at your zoom. The map preview is the unit your intuition trusts.",
    "When exporting polygons for reports, store the radius and unit in the feature properties (the exports here do). Future-you, reopening the file in a GIS, will otherwise have to re-derive what the circle meant.",
  ],
  coordinates: [
    "Adopt one storage format — decimal degrees, WGS84, five or six decimals — for every dataset you own, and convert at the edges for display. Mixed notations in one column are the root of nearly every coordinate bug.",
    "Sanity-check every pasted pair by eye on a map before using it: latitude/longitude swaps land you in the ocean so reliably that 'the Null Island bug' has a name. A two-second visual check costs nothing and catches most transcription errors.",
    "Match precision to source: consumer GPS earns about five decimals; quoting six or seven implies a survey you didn't do. Rounding deliberately is honesty, not loss.",
  ],
  files: [
    "Keep the original file even after converting: GPX→GeoJSON drops timestamps' context, KML→GeoJSON drops styling, and every pipeline has a lossy edge. Originals are cheap; re-acquisition is not.",
    "Validate before trusting exports from unfamiliar tools — open them in a local viewer and check feature counts, bounding boxes and a few property rows. A wrong-axis or swapped-coordinate export is far easier to catch on a map than in a spreadsheet.",
    "For big CSVs, fix the coordinate columns first and map a sample before mapping everything: auto-detection is good but not magical, and one swapped column renders a beautiful map of the wrong ocean.",
  ],
  creation: [
    "Limit each map to one message: pins for places, polygons for areas, rings for reach. When a single figure needs all three, it usually needs two figures instead.",
    "Choose colour for category, not decoration: two or three high-contrast hues read instantly; a rainbow reads as noise. Labels carry identity, colour carries grouping, and the viewport should crop tightly to the subject.",
    "Export twice: an image for the slide and a data format (GeoJSON/CSV) for the record. The image communicates; the data survives editing, and the pair keeps your map honest and reusable.",
  ],
  earth: [
    "Remember that elevation models see bare terrain: no buildings, no forest canopy. A line-of-sight 'clear' verdict can still be blocked by a wood, and a horizon distance assumes open ground — treat results as the terrain baseline, then add land cover from local knowledge.",
    "Include your height inputs explicitly (eye height, mast height, deck level) when sharing visibility results: the same hill answers differently for a child, an adult and a 10 m antenna, and unstated heights make numbers unreproducible.",
    "Treat climate and hardiness outputs as 30-year character, not this year's weather: a zone tells you what winters usually allow, and microclimates — walls, slopes, urban heat — shift a real garden half a zone either way.",
  ],
  sun: [
    "Convert solar times to local clock times deliberately: the sun keeps astronomical time, while governments keep political time, and the gap between them is large in many countries. State both when sharing results.",
    "For photography, plan around sun altitude, not clock time: golden hour is an altitude band, so its clock time migrates with the seasons even at a fixed place — the calculator's windows handle that for you.",
    "When comparing day length across a year, remember the curve is your latitude's signature: near-equatorial sites hover at twelve hours while high latitudes swing wildly. Choose expectations by latitude, not by calendar folklore.",
  ],
  lines: [
    "Use the lines as calibration for other tools: the Equator's 40,075 km circumference is the yardstick that makes great-circle distances legible, and the polar circles make daylight calculators' extremes make sense.",
    "When teaching or writing about meridians, keep datum stories handy — Greenwich's brass line versus the GPS zero, a hundred metres east — because they illustrate, memorably, that coordinate systems are human agreements measured very precisely.",
    "Click along a highlighted line and read coordinates back: watching latitude hold at 23.44° while longitude sweeps the planet turns an abstract parallel into a place you have walked, cursor-first.",
  ],
  population: [
    "State the vintage and definition with every population number you reuse: metro vs municipal vs urban-area figures for the same city differ by multiples, and unstated definitions are how bad comparisons spread.",
    "Use radius sums as lower bounds in rural regions: curated major-city datasets capture the big dots, not the in-between settlement. For funding or legal work, move to census geometry; for screening and comparison, the transparent estimate wins on speed.",
    "Compare with ratios, not differences: density and cost indices are snapshots, and the relationship between two cities is far more stable than either absolute value. That stability is what makes quick comparisons legitimate.",
  ],
